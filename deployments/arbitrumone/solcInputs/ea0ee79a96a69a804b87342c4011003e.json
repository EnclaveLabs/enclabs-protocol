Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

If only one oracle is used, this creates a single point of failure and opens a vector\r\n * for attacking the protocol.\r\n *\r\n * The Resilient Oracle uses multiple sources and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect\r\n * the protocol from oracle attacks. Currently it includes integrations with Chainlink, Pyth, Binance Oracle\r\n * and TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles. TWAP uses PancakeSwap as the on-chain price source.\r\n *\r\n * For every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The oracles are configured per\r\n * vToken's underlying asset address. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot\r\n * oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source.\r\n *\r\n * To validate prices returned from two oracles, we use an upper and lower bound ratio that is set for every\r\n * market. The upper bound ratio represents the deviation between reported price (the price that’s being\r\n * validated) and the anchor price (the price we are validating against) above which the reported price will\r\n * be invalidated. The lower bound ratio presents the deviation between reported price and anchor price below\r\n * which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement\r\n * should be true:\r\n\r\n```\r\nanchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice\r\nisValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio\r\n```\r\n\r\n * In most cases, Chainlink is used as the main oracle, TWAP or Pyth oracles are used as the pivot oracle depending\r\n * on which supports the given market and Binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle. For some markets we may\r\n * use Pyth or TWAP as the main oracle if the token price is not supported by Chainlink or Binance oracles.\r\n *\r\n * For a fetched price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the\r\n * oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.\r\n */\r\ncontract ResilientOracle is PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlledV8, ResilientOracleInterface {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Oracle roles:\r\n     * **main**: The most trustworthy price source\r\n     * **pivot**: Price oracle used as a loose sanity checker\r\n     * **fallback**: The backup source when main oracle price is invalidated\r\n     */\r\n    enum OracleRole {\r\n        MAIN,\r\n        PIVOT,\r\n        FALLBACK\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct TokenConfig {\r\n        /// @notice asset address\r\n        address asset;\r\n        /// @notice `oracles` stores the oracles based on their role in the following order:\r\n        /// [main, pivot, fallback],\r\n        /// It can be indexed with the corresponding enum OracleRole value\r\n        address[3] oracles;\r\n        /// @notice `enableFlagsForOracles` stores the enabled state\r\n        /// for each oracle in the same order as `oracles`\r\n        bool[3] enableFlagsForOracles;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    uint256 public constant INVALID_PRICE = 0;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Native market address\r\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\r\n    address public immutable nativeMarket;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice VAI address\r\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\r\n    address public immutable vai;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Set this as asset address for Native token on each chain.This is the underlying for vBNB (on bsc)\r\n    /// and can serve as any underlying asset of a market that supports native tokens\r\n    address public constant NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDR = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Bound validator contract address\r\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\r\n    BoundValidatorInterface public immutable boundValidator;\r\n\r\n    mapping(address => TokenConfig) private tokenConfigs;\r\n\r\n    event TokenConfigAdded(\r\n        address indexed asset,\r\n        address indexed mainOracle,\r\n        address indexed pivotOracle,\r\n        address fallbackOracle\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is set\r\n    event OracleSet(address indexed asset, address indexed oracle, uint256 indexed role);\r\n\r\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is enabled or disabled\r\n    event OracleEnabled(address indexed asset, uint256 indexed role, bool indexed enable);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Checks whether an address is null or not\r\n     */\r\n    modifier notNullAddress(address someone) {\r\n        if (someone == address(0)) revert(\"can't be zero address\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Checks whether token config exists by checking whether asset is null address\r\n     * @dev address can't be null, so it's suitable to be used to check the validity of the config\r\n     * @param asset asset address\r\n     */\r\n    modifier checkTokenConfigExistence(address asset) {\r\n        if (tokenConfigs[asset].asset == address(0)) revert(\"token config must exist\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Constructor for the implementation contract.
